### **_Getting Started_**

#### Once at the landing page, choose to register, and from there make sure you login. Once logged in, explore the different animal exhibits to get an idea of what animals you'd like to see. When you're ready to plan your visit, navigate to the Schedule to create a schedule and add the exhibits, change the date of your schedule, or delete a schedule that you no longer need.
